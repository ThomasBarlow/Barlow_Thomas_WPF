//  This script will check to see weather I have work in the morning and I need to set an alarm clock.
//  If I do have work it will let me know what time I should set the alarm to.  It will know how much
//  time I need to get ready from a prompt asking so.

//  questions will be:  Do you have work tomorrow?  What time do you have work? How much time do you need to get ready?
